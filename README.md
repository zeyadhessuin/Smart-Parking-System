# Smart-Parking-System
Smart Parking System was a project in our Interface college course. We used a Raspberry Pi with Pic and Arduino to detect cars' existence on the gate and control entry and exit of the garage depending on sending signals between the components. The cars were assigned to the empty spots in the park automatically by using the ESP WiFi module.
